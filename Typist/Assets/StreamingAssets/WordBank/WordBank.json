        "All men dream - but not equally. Those who dream by night, in the dusty recesses of their minds, wake in the day to find that it was vanityâ€¦ But the dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they may act their dream with open eyes, to make it possible. This I did.",
        "My past is not a memory. It's a force at my back. It pushes and steers. I may not always like where it leads me, but like any story, the past needs resolution. What's past is prologue.",
        "What is a man? A Miserable little pile of secrets!"
